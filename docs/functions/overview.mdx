## What does it do?

Cloud Functions for Firebase let you automatically run backend code in response to events
triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your code is stored in Google's cloud
and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

## Installation

Before installing the Cloud Functions for Firebase plugin, ensure that you have followed the [Getting Started](../overview.mdx) documentation
and have initialized FlutterFire.

<Tabs
groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
defaultValue="legacy"
values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">


To develop in a null-safe environment, it is a prerequisite to switch to the correct Flutter channel.

#### Flutter Web, Android & iOS targets:

Web, Android & iOS targets require the Flutter `beta` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel beta
```

#### Flutter desktop targets:

Desktop targets such as macOS requires  the Flutter `dev` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel dev
```

If your app is mixing legacy and null-safe packages, use the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag:
```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

For legacy package imports, place the following ignore comment to hide Dart analyzer warnings:

```dart
// ignore: import_of_legacy_library_into_null_safe
import 'package:firebase_analytics/firebase_analytics.dart';
```

</Tabs>

### 1. Add dependency

Add the [`cloud_functions`](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_functions) dependency to your projects `pubspec.yaml` file:

<Tabs
  groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
  defaultValue="legacy"
  values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">


```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  cloud_functions: "^{{ plugins.cloud_functions }}"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core_ns }}"
  cloud_functions: "^{{ plugins.cloud_functions_ns }}"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Download dependency

Download the dependency by running the following command in your project:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. (Web Only) Add the SDK

If using FlutterFire on the web, add the [`firebase-functions`](!cloud_functions) JavaScript SDK to your `index.html` file:

```html {5} title="web/index.html"
<html>
  ...
  <body>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-functions.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 4. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Cloud Functions for Firebase in your Flutter Project. View
the [Usage documentation](usage.mdx) to get started.
