## Installation

<Tabs
groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
defaultValue="legacy"
values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">

:::caution
This package version is not null safe migrated yet, but has been implemented to be compatible with other null safe FlutterFire packages.
With that in mind, you will need to use the `beta` channel which supports null safe projects.
:::

#### Flutter Web, Android & iOS targets:

Web, Android & iOS targets require the Flutter `beta` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel beta
```

#### Flutter desktop targets:

Desktop targets such as macOS requires  the Flutter `dev` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel dev
```

If your app is mixing legacy and null-safe packages, use the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag:
```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

For legacy package imports, place the following ignore comment to hide Dart analyzer warnings:

```dart
// ignore: import_of_legacy_library_into_null_safe
import 'package:firebase_performance/firebase_performance.dart';
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### 1. Add dependency

<Tabs
  groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
  defaultValue="legacy"
  values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  firebase_performance: "^{{ plugins.firebase_performance }}"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  firebase_performance: "^{{ plugins.firebase_performance_ns }}"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs> 



### 2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. (Web Only) Add the SDK

> Web is currently not supported. See the [FlutterFire roadmap](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2582).

### 4. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Performance Monitoring in your Flutter Project.

> Additional documentation will be available once the Firebase Performance Monitoring plugin update lands as part of the [FlutterFire roadmap](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2582).
